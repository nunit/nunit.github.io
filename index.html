                <p>NUnit is a unit-testing framework for all .Net languages. Initially ported from <a href="https://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a>, the current
                    production release, version 3, has been completely rewritten with many new features and support for a wide range of
                    .NET platforms.</p>

                <p>
                    The NUnit team <a href="/news/update/nunit/2022/02/26/ukraine-statement.html">condemns, in the strongest terms</a>, the
                    unprovoked and abhorrent invasion of Ukraine by the Russian military, in violation of Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter,
                    which prohibits the use of force against the territorial integrity of another state.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Russia's action unnecessarily and unlawfully endangers the lives of millions of people, families, and children. And so,
                    though our core team's voices may be small in number, we nevertheless still use them to call on Russia to end this injustice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We, like so many of our users and contributors, will continually be seeking ways to stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian
                    people. We encourage you to donate to the <a href="https://donate.redcrossredcrescent.org/">Ukrainian Red Cross</a>, something
                    each of us has done. You may also consider other donations at the <a href="https://ukraine.ua/news/stand-with-ukraine/">Stand
                    with Ukraine page provided by the Ukrainian government.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    May Ukraine retain its sovereignty and regain its security, and may the Ukrainian people know peace as soon as possible.

                  The success of NUnit has been made possible through the hard work of our many
                  <a href="https://github.com/nunit/nunit/graphs/contributors">contributors</a> and
                  <a href="https://github.com/orgs/nunit/people">team members</a>. The Core Team thanks everyone for
                  the help and contributions that have made NUnit the success that it is. At last count, the various NUnit packages
                  passed <b>600 million downloads</b> on <a href="https://www.nuget.org/">NuGet.org</a>. We couldn't have done that
                  without the dedication of the many volunteers that donate their time and knowledge to the project.
