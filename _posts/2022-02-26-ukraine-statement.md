The NUnit team condemns, in the strongest terms, the unprovoked and abhorrent invasion of Ukraine by the Russian military, in violation of Article 2(4) of the U.N. Charter, which prohibits the use of force against the territorial integrity of another state.

Russia's action unnecessarily and unlawfully endangers the lives of millions of people, families, and children. And so, though our core team's voices may be small in number, we nevertheless still use them to call on Russia to end this injustice.

We, like so many of our users and contributors, will continually be seeking ways to stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people. We encourage you to donate to the [Ukrainian Red Cross](https://donate.redcrossredcrescent.org/), something each of us has done. You may also consider other donations at the [Stand with Ukraine page provided by the Ukrainian government.](https://ukraine.ua/news/stand-with-ukraine/)

May Ukraine retain its sovereignty and regain its security, and may the Ukrainian people know peace as soon as possible.

Signed,

NUnit Core Team (in alphabetic order of last name)
