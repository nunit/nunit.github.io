This release features a new agent for tests targeting .NET 6.0. In addition, the NETCORE runner (i.e. the dotnet tool) now runs under .NET 6.0, allowing it to execute tests targeting all versions of .NET Core, .NET 5.0 and .NET 6.0. A number of smaller changes are also included.

You can download the NUnit Console from [GitHub](https://github.com/nunit/nunit-console/releases), [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) or [Chocolatey](https://www.chocolatey.org/profiles/nunit.org). See the [release notes](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/release-notes/console-and-engine.html) for more information.
