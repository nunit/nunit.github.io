This release is entirely made up of improvements to the build process and is being released in order to test that process. There are no user-facing bug fixes or improvements in this release as compared to 3.13.0.

This release includes code contributions from [Charlie Poole](https://github.com/CharliePoole) and [Mikkel Nylander Bundgaard](https://github.com/mikkelbu).

You can download the NUnit Console from [GitHub](https://github.com/nunit/nunit-console/releases), [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) or [Chocolatey](https://www.chocolatey.org/profiles/nunit.org).
