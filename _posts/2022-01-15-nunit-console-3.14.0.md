This release features a new agent for tests targeting .NET 5.0. In addition, automation of our publication and release process is now complete from creation of a draft release through releasing to production on GitHub. While this doesn't impact users directly, it will allow us to speed up the introduction of new features in coming releases.

This release includes code contributions from [Charlie Poole](https://github.com/CharliePoole), [Joseph Musser](https://github.com/jnm2), [Mikkel Nylander Bundgaard](https://github.com/mikkelbu) and [Ilia K](https://github.com/k15tfu). Thank you to all those who contributed both in code, and otherwise.

You can download the NUnit Console from [GitHub](https://github.com/nunit/nunit-console/releases), [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) or [Chocolatey](https://www.chocolatey.org/profiles/nunit.org). See the [release notes](https://docs.nunit.org/articles/nunit/release-notes/console-and-engine.html) for more information.
